Intuition: .Basically we need to check for the minimum value of the preFix
            sum in the whole range of prefix sums.
           
           .If its never less than zero than we return 1 or else we return             (minValue * (-1)) + 1 as answer.
// Time complexity: O(N), N is nums.length
// Auxiliary Space: O(1)
class Solution {
    public int minStartValue(int[] nums) {
//taking value of min as 0 as in case if the running sum is never less than one then minimum value required will be 0 + 1 i.e.
        int minValue = 0, runSum = 0;
        for(int num : nums){
            runSum += num;
            minValue = Math.min(minValue, runSum);
        }
        return Math.abs(minValue)+1;
    }
}

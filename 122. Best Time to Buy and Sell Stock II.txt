Intuition: .The logic here is quite simple, whenever the current price is
            lower than the next day's price you buy and add the profit of 
            selling on next day to total profit, it will be same as holding
            the stock if the price is going up continuously.
//Time complexity: O(N), N is prices length
//Auxiliary Space: O(1)                
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int totalProfit = 0;
        for(int indx = 0; indx<prices.length-1; indx++){
            if(prices[indx] < prices[indx+1]){
                totalProfit += (prices[indx+1] - prices[indx]);
            } 
        }
        return totalProfit;
    }
}

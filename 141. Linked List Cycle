We break down the movement of the slow pointer into two steps, the non-cyclic part and the cyclic part:

The slow pointer takes "non-cyclic length" steps to enter the cycle. At this point, the fast pointer has already reached the cycle. \text{Number of iterations} = \text{non-cyclic length} = NNumber of iterations=non-cyclic length=N

Both pointers are now in the cycle. Consider two runners running in a cycle - the fast runner moves 2 steps while the slow runner moves 1 steps at a time. Since the speed difference is 1, it takes \dfrac{\text{distance between the 2 runners}}{\text{difference of speed}} 
difference of speed
distance between the 2 runners
â€‹
  loops for the fast runner to catch up with the slow runner. As the distance is at most "\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K" and the speed difference is 1, we conclude that
\text{Number of iterations} = \text{almost}Number of iterations=almost "\text{cyclic length K}cyclic length K".

Therefore, the worst case time complexity is O(N+K)O(N+K), which is O(n)O(n).

Space complexity : O(1)O(1). We only use two nodes (slow and fast) so the space complexity is O(1)O(1).
